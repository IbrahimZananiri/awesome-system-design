# Design Uber, a ride-hailing system

## Challenge

Have you ever wondered what goes behind the scenes when you simply tap to request an Uber ride, get matched with a driver, to get you from one location to another, all through your mobile device?

Letâ€™s design the architecture for a ride-hailing system like Uber or Lyft!

- The rider is matched with a driver/ride who accepts to take the ride, and starts to see trip updates on a map
- Driver drops the rider off at their chosen destination and the system charges the rider.
- Routes are recorded and persisted for safety and to enable the experience.
- The system should determine and notify nearby drivers within less than 100ms


### Scale of the System
- 500 million riders
- 10 million drivers
- 1 million concurrent users
- 25 million trips daily
