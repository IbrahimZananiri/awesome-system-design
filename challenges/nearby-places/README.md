# Search Nearby Places

## Challenge

Searching for nearby places within walking distance, restaurants within your vicinity, or hailing nearbt cab drivers. All are use-cases that require proximity search in one way or another.

Consumer apps we use today, like Google Maps and Uber use proximity search to enable their core features. They are blazing fast and manage to complete our request within a fraction of a second!

How would you be able to achieve fast proximity-based search?

How would you structure your data and index places for efficiency?

How can you scale to hundreds of millions of places and concurrent requests?
